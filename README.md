Please read contributing.md for further information.

TLDR: Use the Python Directory in the master branch as a reference. When starting to work on something, make sure you branch off of the respective branch (i.e. if you are working on developing for python, branch out of the python_dev branch.) If the branch doesnt exist, branch off the dev branch and call it <language>_dev.
